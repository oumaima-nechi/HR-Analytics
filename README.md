# HR-Analytics
### Introduction

I analyzed employee attrition (also known as churn, which refers to the gradual reduction in the number of employees over time) using Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service. The project involved data modeling, exploring turnover patterns, using DAX functions for advanced calculations, and designing interactive reports. 

Data-driven insights can enhance retention strategies and HR decision-making. The Atlas Labs HR team now has easy access to crucial employee metrics. This empowers informed decisions, from hiring to diversity and inclusion monitoring, as well as performance and attrition tracking.
